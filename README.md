=================

Snip.It API documentation. This is a public repository built using [Nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org)

Most of the resources and approach to documentation is taken from [GitHub](https://github.com/github/developer.github.com/blob/master/README.md). 

As we diverge from their approach we'll document more here.
